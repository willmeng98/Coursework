(2) For HIV2, answer the following based on your tree:

Which primate did it likely come from? 
It most likely came from the primate Scooty Mangabey. 

Assuming the virus can jump to human, but cannot easily go the other way, how many host-switch events appear to be involved? Explain.


(3) For HIV1, answer the following based on your tree:

Which primate did it likely come from? 
It most likely came from 

Assuming the virus can jump to human, but cannot easily go the other way, how many host-switch events appear to be involved? Explain.

(4) Clearly, the host switch events examined in (2) and (3) are not consistent with pure co-evolution of host and virus. Are the host and virus trees otherwise consistent with pure co-evolution? Explain your answer.

(5) You reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between seven species (A-B) using the neighbor joining algorithm, and obtain the following unrooted tree:


You are trying to solve one particular question. You want to know what the smallest clade is that contains both B and F. However, in order to do so you need to figure out how to root your tree. So you go to the primary literature and look for journal articles with previously published information on the relationships. You hope that such information can help you figure out how to root the tree, and thus answer your question. 


A. In one journal article you find evidence for the following relationships between A, B and C


Use this information to figure out where the neighbor-joining tree should be rooted. Then write down the smallest clade that contains both B and F. (ie, give all the species in that clade).

B. You find a second article that implies the following relationships between A, D and G: 

Now try using this information (instead of the information in part A) to figure out where the neighbor-joining tree should be rooted. Then write down the smallest clade that contains both B and F. (ie, give all the species in that clade).
